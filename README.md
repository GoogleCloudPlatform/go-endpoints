# Cloud Endpoints for Go

This package will let you write Cloud Endpoints backends in Go.

If you're not familiar with Cloud Endpoints, see Google App Engine official
documentation for [Python][1] or [Java][2].


## Install

```bash
go get -u github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/go-endpoints/endpoints
```

## Usage

Declare structs which describe your data. For instance:

```go
// Greeting is a datastore entity that represents a single greeting.
// It also serves as (a part of) a response of GreetingService.
type Greeting struct {
  Key     *datastore.Key `json:"id" datastore:"-"`
  Author  string         `json:"author"`
  Content string         `json:"content" datastore:",noindex" endpoints:"req"`
  Date    time.Time      `json:"date"`
}

// GreetingsList is a response type of GreetingService.List method
type GreetingsList struct {
  Items []*Greeting `json:"items"`
}

// Request type for GreetingService.List
type GreetingsListReq struct {
  Limit int `json:"limit" endpoints:"d=10"`
}
```

Then, a service:

```go
// GreetingService can sign the guesbook, list all greetings and delete
// a greeting from the guestbook.
type GreetingService struct {
}

// List responds with a list of all greetings ordered by Date field.
// Most recent greets come first.
func (gs *GreetingService) List(c endpoints.Context, r *GreetingsListReq) (*GreetingsList, error) {
  if r.Limit <= 0 {
    r.Limit = 10
  }

  q := datastore.NewQuery("Greeting").Order("-Date").Limit(r.Limit)
  greets := make([]*Greeting, 0, r.Limit)
  keys, err := q.GetAll(c, &greets)
  if err != nil {
    return nil, err
  }

  for i, k := range keys {
    greets[i].Key = k
  }
  return &GreetingsList{greets}, nil
}
```

Last step is to make the above available as a **discoverable API**
and leverage all the juicy stuff Cloud Endpoints are great at.

```go
import "github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/go-endpoints/endpoints"

func init() {
  greetService := &GreetingService{}
  api, err := endpoints.RegisterService(greetService,
    "greeting", "v1", "Greetings API", true)
  if err != nil {
    panic(err.Error())
  }

  info := api.MethodByName("List").Info()
  info.Name, info.HTTPMethod, info.Path, info.Desc =
    "greets.list", "GET", "greetings", "List most recent greetings."

  endpoints.HandleHTTP()
}
```

Don't forget to add URL matching in app.yaml:

```yaml
application: my-app-id
version: v1
threadsafe: true

runtime: go
api_version: go1

handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: _go_app

# Important! Even though there's a catch all routing above,
# without these two lines it's not going to work.
# Make sure you have this:
- url: /_ah/spi/.*
  script: _go_app
```

That's it. It is time to start dev server and enjoy the discovery doc at
[localhost:8080/_ah/api/discovery/v1/apis/greeting/v1/rest][5]

Naturally, API Explorer works too:
[localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer][6]

Time to deploy the app on [appengine.appspot.com][7]!

**N.B.** At present, you can't map your endpoint URL to a custom domain. Bossylobster 
[wrote](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16124815/1745000): "It's a non-trivial networking problem
and something Google certainly plan on supporting in the future. Keep in mind, Cloud Endpoints 
is a combination or App Engine and Google's API Infrastructure."

## Generate client libs

Now that we have the discovery doc, let's generate some client libraries.

### Android

```
$ URL='https://my-app-id.appspot.com/_ah/api/discovery/v1/apis/greeting/v1/rest'
$ curl -s $URL > greetings.rest.discovery

# Optionally check the discovery doc
$ less greetings.rest.discovery

$ GO_SDK/endpointscfg.py gen_client_lib java greetings.rest.discovery
```

You should be able to find `./greetings.rest.zip` file with Java client source
code and its dependencies.

Once you have that, follow the official guide:
[Using Endpoints in an Android Client][8].

### iOS

```
# Note the rpc suffix in the URL:
$ URL='https://my-app-id.appspot.com/_ah/api/discovery/v1/apis/greeting/v1/rpc'
$ curl -s $URL > greetings.rpc.discovery

# Optionally check the discovery doc
$ less greetings.rpc.discovery
```

Then, feed `greetings.rpc.discovery` file to the library generator on OS X as
described in the official guide [Using Endpoints in an iOS Client][9].

###Â JavaScript

There's really nothing to generate for JavaScript, you just use it!

Here's the official guide: [Using Endpoints in a JavaScript client][10].

### Dart


```
# Clone or fork discovery_api_dart_client_generator
git clone https://github.com/dart-gde/discovery_api_dart_client_generator
cd discovery_api_dart_client_generator
pub install

# Generate your client library:
URL='https://my-app-id.appspot.com/_ah/api/discovery/v1/apis/greeting/v1/rest'
curl -s -o greetings.rpc.discovery $URL
bin/generate.dart --no-prefix -i greetings.rpc.discovery -o ../
```

Now you just have to add your endpoints client library to your dart application (assuming it is in the parent directory.)

```
cd ../my-app_dart/
cat >>pubspec.yaml <<EOF
  my-app-id_v1_api:
  path: ../dart_my-app-id_v1_api_client
EOF
```

Take a look at the api client [examples](https://github.com/dart-gde/dart_api_client_examples) to
get a feel on how to use your library.

## Docs

  - [Go endpoints package docs][11]
  - [Wiki of this repo][12]


## Samples

Check out the famous [TicTacToe app][3]. It has its own readme file.

Or you can just play it on the [live demo app][13].

## Running tests

You'll need Google App Engine SDK for Go to run tests.

Once you get that installed, use `goapp` tool to run all tests from the root 
of this repo:

```
GO_APPENGINE_SDK/goapp test ./endpoints
```

The tool uses API server bundled with the SDK, which outputs lots of debugging
info. You can suppress that with:

```
GO_APPENGINE_SDK/goapp test -v ./endpoints 2> /dev/null
```
