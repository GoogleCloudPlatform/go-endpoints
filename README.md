# Notice

This package provides Go support for Cloud Endpoints Frameworks v1, which is **DEPRECATED**
and will be shut down on August 2, 2018.

This package is unmaintained and comes with no support or guarantee.

If used this product and were primarily interested in code generation and API specifications, you should probably
investigate the [OpenAPI specification](https://www.google.com/search?q=golang+openapi) and ecosystem.

If you want API authentication and monitoring, you should check out the newer
Google Cloud Endpoints product (using [OpenAPI](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/) or [gRPC](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/)).
Unfortunately, App Engine standard is not supported, so you will need to move your API to App Engine flexible, Compute Engine, or Kubernetes.

# Cloud Endpoints for Go

This package will let you write Cloud Endpoints backends in Go.

If you're not familiar with Cloud Endpoints, see Google App Engine official
documentation for [Python][1] or [Java][2].

## Install

Use [goapp tool][goapp] from the Google App Engine SDK for Go to get the package:

```
GO_APPENGINE/goapp get github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/go-endpoints/endpoints
```

If you'll ever need to pull updates from the upstream, execute `git pull`
from the root of this repo.

Alternatively, if you don't have `goapp` for some reason, do the standard

```
go get github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/go-endpoints/endpoints
```

If this is not the first time you're "getting" the package,
add `-u` param to get an updated version, i.e. `go get -u ...`.

Now, you'll see a couple errors:

```
package appengine: unrecognized import path "appengine"
package appengine/user: unrecognized import path "appengine/user"
package appengine_internal/user: unrecognized import path "appengine_internal/user"
```

which is OK, don't worry! The issue here is Go looks at all imports in
`endpoints` package and cannot find "appengine/*" packages nowhere in your
`$GOPATH`. That's because they're not there, indeed. Appengine packages are
normally available only when running an app with dev appserver, and since that's
precisely what we want to do, "unrecognized import path" errors can be safely
ignored.


## Usage

Declare structs which describe your data. For instance:

```go
// Greeting is a datastore entity that represents a single greeting.
// It also serves as (a part of) a response of GreetingService.
type Greeting struct {
  Key     *datastore.Key `json:"id" datastore:"-"`
  Author  string         `json:"author"`
  Content string         `json:"content" datastore:",noindex" endpoints:"req"`
  Date    time.Time      `json:"date"`
}

// GreetingsList is a response type of GreetingService.List method
type GreetingsList struct {
  Items []*Greeting `json:"items"`
}

// Request type for GreetingService.List
type GreetingsListReq struct {
  Limit int `json:"limit" endpoints:"d=10"`
}
```

Then, a service:

```go
// GreetingService can sign the guesbook, list all greetings and delete
// a greeting from the guestbook.
type GreetingService struct {
}

// List responds with a list of all greetings ordered by Date field.
// Most recent greets come first.
func (gs *GreetingService) List(c context.Context, r *GreetingsListReq) (*GreetingsList, error) {
  if r.Limit <= 0 {
    r.Limit = 10
  }

  q := datastore.NewQuery("Greeting").Order("-Date").Limit(r.Limit)
  greets := make([]*Greeting, 0, r.Limit)
  keys, err := q.GetAll(c, &greets)
  if err != nil {
    return nil, err
  }

  for i, k := range keys {
    greets[i].Key = k
  }
  return &GreetingsList{greets}, nil
}
```

We can also define methods that don't require a response or a request.
```go
// Add adds a greeting.
func (gs *GreetingService) Add(c context.Context, g *Greeting) error {
    k := datastore.NewIncompleteKey(c, "Greeting", nil)
    _, err := datastore.Put(c, k, g)
    return err
}

type Count struct {
    N int `json:"count"`
}

// Count returns the number of greetings.
func (gs *GreetingService) Count(c context.Context) (*Count, error) {
    n, err := datastore.NewQuery("Greeting").Count(c)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return &Count{n}, nil
}
```

Last step is to make the above available as a **discoverable API**
and leverage all the juicy stuff Cloud Endpoints are great at.

```go
import "github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/go-endpoints/endpoints"

func init() {
  greetService := &GreetingService{}
  api, err := endpoints.RegisterService(greetService,
    "greeting", "v1", "Greetings API", true)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Register service: %v", err)
  }

  register := func(orig, name, method, path, desc string) {
      m := api.MethodByName(orig)
      if m == nil {
          log.Fatalf("Missing method %s", orig)
      }
      i := m.Info()
      i.Name, i.HTTPMethod, i.Path, i.Desc = name, method, path, desc
  }

  register("List", "greets.list", "GET", "greetings", "List most recent greetings.")
  register("Add", "greets.add", "PUT", "greetings", "Add a greeting.")
  register("Count", "greets.count", "GET", "greetings/count", "Count all greetings.")
  endpoints.HandleHTTP()
}
```

Don't forget to add URL matching in app.yaml:

```yaml
application: my-app-id
version: v1
threadsafe: true

runtime: go
api_version: go1

handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: _go_app

# Important! Even though there's a catch all routing above,
# without these two lines it's not going to work.
# Make sure you have this:
- url: /_ah/spi/.*
  script: _go_app
```

That's it. It is time to start dev server and enjoy the discovery doc at
[localhost:8080/_ah/api/discovery/v1/apis/greeting/v1/rest][5]

Naturally, API Explorer works too:
[localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer][6]

Time to deploy the app on [appengine.appspot.com][7]!

**N.B.** At present, you can't map your endpoint URL to a custom domain. Bossylobster
[wrote](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16124815/1745000): "It's a non-trivial networking problem
and something Google certainly plan on supporting in the future. Keep in mind, Cloud Endpoints
is a combination or App Engine and Google's API Infrastructure."

## Generate client libs

Now that we have the discovery doc, let's generate some client libraries.

### Android

```
$ URL='https://my-app-id.appspot.com/_ah/api/discovery/v1/apis/greeting/v1/rest'
$ curl -s $URL > greetings.rest.discovery

# Optionally check the discovery doc
$ less greetings.rest.discovery

$ GO_SDK/endpointscfg.py gen_client_lib java greetings.rest.discovery
```

You should be able to find `./greetings.rest.zip` file with Java client source
code and its dependencies.

Once you have that, follow the official guide:
[Using Endpoints in an Android Client][8].

### iOS

```
# Note the rpc suffix in the URL:
$ URL='https://my-app-id.appspot.com/_ah/api/discovery/v1/apis/greeting/v1/rpc'
$ curl -s $URL > greetings.rpc.discovery

# Optionally check the discovery doc
$ less greetings.rpc.discovery
```

Then, feed `greetings.rpc.discovery` file to the library generator on OS X as
described in the official guide [Using Endpoints in an iOS Client][9].

###Â JavaScript

There's really nothing to generate for JavaScript, you just use it!

Here's the official guide: [Using Endpoints in a JavaScript client][10].

### Dart


```
# Clone or fork discovery_api_dart_client_generator
git clone https://github.com/dart-gde/discovery_api_dart_client_generator
cd discovery_api_dart_client_generator
pub install

# Generate your client library:
mkdir input
URL='https://my-app-id.appspot.com/_ah/api/discovery/v1/apis/greeting/v1/rest'
curl -s -o input/greeting.json $URL
bin/generate.dart package -i input -o ../dart_my-app-id_v1_api_client --package-name my-app-id_v1_api
```

Now you just have to add your endpoints client library to your dart application (assuming it is in the parent directory.)

```
cd ../my-app_dart/
cat >>pubspec.yaml <<EOF
  my-app-id_v1_api:
  path: ../dart_my-app-id_v1_api_client
EOF
```

Take a look at the api client [examples](https://github.com/dart-gde/dart_api_client_examples) to
get a feel on how to use your library.

## Docs

  - [Go endpoints package docs][11]
  - [Wiki of this repo][12]


## Samples

Check out the famous [TicTacToe app][3]. It has its own readme file.

Or you can just play it on the [live demo app][13].

## Running tests

You'll need Google App Engine SDK for Go to run tests.

Once you get that installed, use `goapp` tool to run all tests from the root
of this repo:

```
GO_APPENGINE_SDK/goapp test ./endpoints
```

The tool uses API server bundled with the SDK, which outputs lots of debugging
info. You can suppress that with:

```
GO_APPENGINE_SDK/goapp test -v ./endpoints 2> /dev/null
```
